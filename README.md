# Resytable

## What and why?
- Resytable is an app designed to recommend restaurants
- The main feature the app offers is the swiping interaction on restaurant recommendations. Users can swipe on restaurants that pop up on their feeds, responding either yes or no to that recommendation. Over time, as more data is collected on a user's preferences in various factors (cuisine, price, time of day, etc.), the app aims to provide better and more customized recommendations
- Resytable solves the problem of the lack of interactive recommendations. Current popular food apps such as Beli, Resy and others provide feedback sharing and other features, but are boring to use
- Swiping is effortless and can provide more hidden restaurant options to those who aren't willing to spend their time to do their own digging

## For whom?
- This app is built for food and restaurants enthusiasts, or whose hoping to find appropriate restaurants for different occasions

## How?
- Users log into the app and immediately sees the first restaurant recommendation. Then, proceed to swipe right (for like) or swipe left (for don't like). After that, the next restaurant shows up
- App will recurringly asks users that if they eventually went to individual restaurant that they liked, and if so, to leave a rating or share with friends
- Users can add friends to share ratings and photos. The app will also display fun features such as a taste bud score and your average budget on meals
- Based on a user's like patterns and frequency, the app will aim to provide better recommendations
- Users can see other interesting statistics such as the average number of times dining out, average money spent per meal, cuisine preference, and other archetypes

## Scope
- Resytable can be appropriately and timely developed by a group of ~5 developers within this semester. The focus would be on the frontend and user interface, not the machine learning algorithm behind the recommendation engine
