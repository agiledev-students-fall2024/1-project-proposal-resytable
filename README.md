# Resytable

## What and why?
- Resytable is an app designed to recommend restaurants
- The main feature the app offers is the swiping interaction on restaurant recommendations. Users can swipe on restaurants that pop up on their feeds, responding either yes or no to that recommendation. Over time, as more data is collected on a user's preferences in various factors (cuisine, price, time of day, etc.), the app aims to provide better and more customized recommendations
- Resytable solves the problem of the lack of interactive recommendations. Current popular food apps such as Beli, Resy and others provide feedback sharing and other features, but are boring to use
- Swiping is effortless and can provide more hidden restaurant options to those who aren't willing to spend their time to do their own digging
